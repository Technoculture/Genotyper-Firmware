# Objectives
* To calibrate the electronic pipette for orchestrator.
* To standardize the motor movements calculations for pipetting action for certain amount of liquid.



# Setup
* To calibrate the electronic pipette we need to fix the vertical axis.
* There should not be any other travelling in x axis.
* Only vertical axis(Y) will move and electronic pipette(Z axis) 
* All movements should be as slow as possible to minimize the motor vibrations.
* There should not be any air flow.
* To maintain zero air flow we have designed our custom acrylic enclosure which is transparent
* A temperature humidity sensor is placed inside the acrylic enclosure to monitor the environment.


# Process

* Vertical axis will go upward and stays there for a certain time duration as well it takes liquid into the pipette.
* Vertical axis comes down and a weighing machine is placed under the electronic pipette where the liquid is dispensed into an aluminum foil container.

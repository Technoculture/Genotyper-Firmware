* Firmware for Genotyper

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
‚ùóThis repository uses various development dependencies for managing code formatting (clang-format, uncrustify), commit messages(husky, commitlint). 
These should be set up properly. Refer to Getting Started page on the project wiki.

To setup the zephyr environment with the west tool and for more details, refer to [Getting started]{https://github.com/TechnocultureResearch/Genotyper-Firmware/wiki}.

** Build an application

To build an application (For example, the TMP100 sensor) using the west tool, navigate to the workspace and run

`west build -p auto -b nrf52840dk_nrf52811 samples/sensor/tmp100`

`-p` ensures a pristine (clean) build.

`-b` is used to specify the board name.

After the build process is completed, run

`west flash --erase`

This will flash the executable file generated onto the flash memory of the target board.

The `minicom` serial monitor is needed to view the sensor output on the console.

Run 

`minicom -D /dev/ttyACM* -b 115200` 

`-D` specifies the device connected to the port.

`-b` specifies the baudrate of transmission overriding the value mentioned in the minicom's configuration file.

** Build an application

=dev= branch is WIP. To build the application, switch to =work-sp= branch.

To build an application (For example, the TMP100 sensor) using the west tool, navigate to the workspace and run

*** Build

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
west build -p auto -b nrf52840dk_nrf52811 samples/sensor/tmp100
#+END_SRC

- =-p= ensures a pristine (clean) build.
- =-b= is used to specify the board name.
 
*** Flash
After the build process is completed, run

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
west flash --erase
#+END_SRC

This will flash the executable file generated onto the flash memory of the target board.

*** Console
The =minicom= serial monitor is needed to view the sensor output on the console.

Run

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
minicom -D /dev/ttyACM* -b 115200
#+END_SRC

- =-D= specifies the device connected to the port.
- =-b= specifies the baudrate of transmission overriding the value mentioned in the minicom's configuration file.

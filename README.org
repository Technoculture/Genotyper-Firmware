To setup the zephyr environment with the west tool and for more details, refer to [Getting started]{https://github.com/TechnocultureResearch/Genotyper-Firmware/wiki}.

** Build an application

To build an application (For example, the TMP100 sensor) using the west tool, navigate to the workspace and run

`west build -p auto -b nrf52840dk_nrf52811 samples/sensor/tmp100`

`-p` ensures a pristine (clean) build.

`-b` is used to specify the board name.

After the build process is completed, run

`west flash --erase`

This will flash the executable file generated onto the flash memory of the target board.

The `minicom` serial monitor is needed to view the sensor output on the console.

Run 

`minicom -D /dev/ttyACM* -b 115200` 

`-D` specifies the device connected to the port.

`-b` specifies the baudrate of transmission overriding the value mentioned in the minicom's configuration file.
